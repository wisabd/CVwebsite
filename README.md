# AI Engineer and Computational Physicist

### Summary
Graduate student at University of Bologna specializing in generative learning and high energy physics in
particular using generative models for physics simulations. Experienced in HPC systems, deep neural networks,
and performance optimization. Over the past year, I have optimized and containerized a GAN model using Singu‑
larity for particle physics research at CERN. Looking to translate research training into industrial outputs, helping
businesses make production‑ready applied AI products.
