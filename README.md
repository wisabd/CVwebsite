### Summary
Graduate student at University of Bologna specializing in generative learning and high energy physics in
particular using generative models for physics simulations. Experienced in HPC systems, deep neural networks,
and performance optimization. Over the past year, I have optimized and containerized a GAN model using Singu‑
larity for particle physics research at CERN. Looking to translate research training into industrial outputs, helping
businesses make production‑ready applied AI products.

### Technical Skills
**Programming:** Python, C/C++, Bash, MATLAB
**HPC and AI:** HPC Simulations, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), Performance Optimization
**Software Development Tools:** Git, Debugging, Build Systems (CMake, Makefile), GitLab
**Containerization & Cloud:** Docker, Singularity
**OS and Workflows:** Linux Command Line, Research Data Management

### Opensource
**Advanced RAG pipelines powered by LLMs**
• Built a sub-question query system, 
**CNN-based self driving car simulation**
• ad
**Gradient boosting trees for bankruptcy prediction in Poland**
• asd

### Research
**Master Thesis Project @ ATLAS Collaboration,  Geneva, Switzerland (_August 2024 - Present_)**
•Tuned hyperparameters of the BoloGAN, a conditional WGAN‑Gradient Penalty model simulating ATLAS calorimeter, using grid search
algorithm based on the validation metric of reduced chi squares between Geant4 and generated energy distributions, on LXBATCH
cluster at CERN.
• Developed python scripts for data analysis, bash scripts for running jobs on HPC system, wrote Keras callbacks, utilized Tensorboard
dashboards, and generated parallel coordinate graphs using Matplotlib.
